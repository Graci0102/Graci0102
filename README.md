## Hi there 👋

My name is Gál László Zsolt, and I'am a Student learning Computer Science in Obuda University

- 💼 I’m currently looking for Intern job oportunities preferably in Testing and FrontEnd, but BackEnd and DevOps is also fine.

I Want to showcase my work in here so that people can see what i was up to in uni up until now.
- 📷 I've recently built a sobel filter for my CUDA programming lessons. The program only showcases the results, there is no output file.
- 🗣 Also I've worked on a Project with my Classmates, where we wrote a LAN ChatRoom application in C that only works on Linux. My main job was making the sockets, that creates the communicatons between clients.
- 🌍 Another project i will mention is an app I've created that demonstrates a REST API via Swagger in c#.
