## Hi there 👋

My name is Gál László Zsolt, and I'am a Student learning Computer Science in Obuda University

- 💼 I’m currently looking for Intern job oportunities preferably in Testing and FrontEnd, but BackEnd and DevOps is also fine.

I Want to showcase my work in here so that people can see what i was up to in uni up until now.
- 📷 I've recently built a [sobel filter](https://github.com/Graci0102/CudaSobelFilter.git) for my CUDA programming lessons. The program only showcases the results, there is no output file.
- 🗣 Also I've worked on a Project with my Classmates, where we wrote a [LAN ChatRoom](https://github.com/Dev-Levy/C_LAN_Chatroom.git) application in C that only works on Linux. My main job was making the sockets, that creates the communicatons between clients.
- 🌍 Another project i will mention is an app I've created that demonstrates a REST API via Swagger in c#. You can check it out [here] (https://github.com/Graci0102/Ticket-Collector.git)
